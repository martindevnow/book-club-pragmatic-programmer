You’ll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career.

### Meeting agenda:

We get together every two weeks for **an hour** to talk about the chapter(s). Each meeting consists of an informal 5-10 min summary review then discussion, e.g. [lean coffee](http://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/) style or whatever structure the group prefers. For example, we could discuss what we found helpful, unhelpful, and needed clarifying.

As you read chapters, if you think of something you want to ask or discuss ahead of meeting time, you can also jot it down to discuss on the day.

Finally, while it's to your benefit to read the chapter ahead of time, it's not mandatory and you should aim to come to book club regardless. Questions from all levels of experience helps solidify everyone's learning.
